PATIENT PREPARATION
 *I'd ensure that the patient was in a supine position*
 *I'd position the patient's head and neck in a neutral position*
 > Ensure that the patient's airway is clear of any secretions or obstructions

OPA INSERTION
 *I'd measure from the patient's earlobe to the corner of their mouth*
 *I'd select an appropriately-sized OPA based on the patient's size and anatomy*
 *I'd hold the OPA with the concave surface facing upwards*
 *I'd open the patient's mouth*
 *I'd insert the OPA with the tip pointing towards the hard palate*
 *I'd advance the OPA along the contour of the tongue*
 *I'd advance until the flange rests against the patient's teeth*

CONFIRMATION OF PLACEMENT
 *I'd get a laryngoscope blade and connect it to a handle*
 *I'd insert the laryngoscope into the patient's mouth*
 *I'd ensure the OPA was placed correctly in the oropharynx*
