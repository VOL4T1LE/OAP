PREREQUISITES
 > At least one Peripheral Intravenous Line
 > Adequate oxygenation

SITE ACQUISITION & PREPARATION
 > In focal brain injuries, select the most injured side
 > In multifocal brain injuries (diffuse injuries), select the right (nondominant) hemisphere
 *I'd select the appropriate hemisphere for the ICP probe*
 *I'd mark 2-3cm anterior to the coronal suture in a plane with the midpupillary line behind the hairline*
 *I'd shave around the designated incision site*
 *I'd sterilise the site with 2% Chlorhexidine*
 *I'd measure and mark the incision site*
 *I'd get a #10 scalpel*
 *I'd get a cranial perforator*
 *I'd attach a 2.71mm drill bit to the perforator and ensure it is secure*
 *I'd ensure the perforator's safety stop is functioning*

PRE-TREATMENT
 *I'd prepare 500mg of Amoxicillin*
 *I'd ensure there were no impurities present*
 *I'd connect it to the set and push the 500mg of Amoxicillin*

LOCAL INFILTRATION
 *I'd get a 3mL syringe with a 25 gauge needle*
 *I'd prep 3mL of 1% Lidocaine Hydrochloride*
 *I'd ensure no impurities were present in the solution*
 *I'd locally infiltrate the anaesthetic around the marked site in a radial fashion*
 *I'd continue until a wheal is visible*

INCISION
 *I'd make a linear 0.5cm incision*
 *I'd extend the incision down through the subcutaneous fat*
 *I'd use a small skin retractor to widen the incision*
 *I'd retract the subcutaneous fat*
 *I'd scrape off the periosteum to expose the cranium*

BONE DRILLING
 *I'd position the perforator 10 degrees from perpendicular to the incision site*
 *I'd carefully perforate the skull and retract then device*
 *I'd irrigate the site with Normal Saline Solution*

MONITOR SETUP
 *I'd get a #18 Spinal Needle*
 *I'd carefully perforate the dura with the needle*
 *I'd manually screw the bolt into the skull*
 *I'd screw to approximately 1cm of depth*
 *I'd insert the stylet through the bolt to remove any bone or soft tissue debris*
 *I'd connect a fibreoptic catheter to an ICP monitor*
 *I'd zero the fibreoptic catheter*
 *I'd insert the fibreoptic catheter through the bolt to a depth of 1.5cm*
 *I'd ensure the catheter was not under pressure against anything*
 *I'd turn the compression cap clockwise to secure the monitor*
 *I'd place a Tegaderm*
 *I'd assess the ICP waveform*
