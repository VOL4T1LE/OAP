DIGITAL NIBP MEASUREMENT
 *I'd get a digital sphygmomanometer*
 *I'd connect an NIBP cuff to the device*
 *I'd wrap the NIBP cuff 2cm superior to one of the patient's antecubital fossae*
 *I'd inflate the cuff via the device*
 *I'd wait for the cuff to deflate*
 *I'd assess the NIBP calculated by the device*
 *I'd remove the NIBP cuff*
