PRERQUISITES
 > A patent airway, not at immediate risk of compromise
 > Relevant airway adjuncts as appropriate
 > Ideally, an Oropharyngeal Airway or Nasopharyngeal Airway should already be in place

PREPARATION
 *I'd ensure the patient was supine*
 *I'd retrieve a ZX oxygen cylinder*
 *I'd get some oxygen tubing*
 *I'd get a self-inflating bag ventilator*
 *I'd connect an appropriately sized mask to the self-inflating bag ventilator*
 *I'd connect the oxygen tubing to the BVM oxygen inlet*
 *I'd connect the other end to the oxygen cylinder*

MASK SITUATION
 *I'd place the nasal portion of the mask over the nose*
 *I'd lower the rest of the BVM mask*
 *I'd ensure the mask made a proper seal*
 *I'd extend my fingers underneath the patient's mandible and pull it upwards*
 > This manoeuvre is similar to the Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift Technique, and further opens the airway
 > Make sure to only pull up the bony parts of the mandible, as pressure to the soft areas may obstruct the airway
 *Maintaining this upward traction, I'd press the mask downwards to get a good seal*

OXYGEN THERAPY
 *I'd set the flow of oxygen from the cylinder to 15LPM*
 *I'd hold the mask/ventilator with a CE grip*
 *I'd steadily squeeze the bag over one second per ventilation*
 *I'd ventilate at a rate of 8 respirations per minute*
 *I'd ensure the chest rises during each ventilation*
