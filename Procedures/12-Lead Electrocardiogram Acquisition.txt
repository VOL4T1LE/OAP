PREREQUISITES
 > Ensure that the skin of the patient's chest is exposed
 > Shave excess hair follicles in a 2cm diameter around the desired electrode site(s)
 > Using a 2% Chlorhexidine wipe, abrade desired electrode sites to remove loose skin, body oil, sweat, etc
 > Allow sites to dry before placing electrodes

LEAD PLACEMENT
 *I'd remove 12 electrodes connected to an ECG Leadwire from the pack*
 *I'd ensure all electrodes were still conductive*
 *I'd position all the limb electrodes equidistantly*
 *I'd get the precordial electrodes V1 and V2*
 *I'd place both electrodes equidistantly proximal to the sternum and superficial to the 4th ICS*
 *I'd place precordial electrode V4 at the mid-clavicular line, superficial to the 5th ICS*
 *I'd place precordial electrode V3 between V2 and V4*
 *I'd place precordial electrode V6 at the mid-axillary line, superficial to the 5th ICS*
 *I'd place precordial electrode V5 between V4 and V6*
 *I'd ensure all electrodes make full contact with the skin*

ECG ACQUISITION & INTERPRETATION
 *I'd assess bipolar Leads I to III*
 *I'd assess the unipolar augmented vector leads R, L, and F*
 *I'd assess the unipolar precordial leads V1 to V6*
 *I'd assess the morphology of the rhythms displayed*
 *I'd interpret the ECG measurement*
