NIBP ASSESSMENT
 *I'd get an aneroid NIBP cuff and a stethoscope*
 *I'd wrap the NIBP cuff 2cm superior to the antecubital fossa*
 *I'd manually inflate the cuff*
 > Ensure that the cuff is tight enough to cause the distension of distal blood vessels
 *I'd locate and palpate the brachial artery*
 *I'd place the bell of the stethoscope superficial to the antecubital fossa*
 *I'd deflate the NIBP cuff*
 *I'd listen to the phase I korotkoff sounds*
 *I'd note down the pressure on the gauge as the systolic BP*
 *I'd listen to the phase IV / V korotkoff sounds*
 *I'd note down the pressure on the gauge as the diastolic BP*
 *I'd remove the NIBP cuff*
