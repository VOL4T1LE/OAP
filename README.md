# Operational Aid Program

## ---  Work In Progress  ---

### Disclaimers
1. Users are required to have at least [Version 3.11.1 of Python](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.1/python-3.11.1-amd64.exe) already installed to facilitate the successful execution of the python scripts that make up the program.
2. This program was created, and is being maintained, by a single inexperienced person, therefore the dates of updates and patches may vary significantly and there are likely to be some minor spelling errors and/or bugs.
3. This program is currently only confirmed as being compatible with the Microsoft Windows 10 Operating System
4. Any tampering with the file structure or the files themselves will likely result in undesired behaviour

### Current Functions
- Three search utilities available for over 40 different procedures, over 10 memory aids, and 3 medical substances
- A rudimentary LIFEPAK 15 option, designed to somewhat emulate the display of the aforementioned patient vital sign monitor

### Planned Functions
- New option designed to aid in the declaration and event logging of major or significant incidents
