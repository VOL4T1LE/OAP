PRE-PORCEDURE CONSIDERATIONS
 > Ensure that the patient is in a safe and comfortable position
 > Consider the administration of an appropriate Analgesic

 > Consider the necessity for the administration of an Antifibrinolytic
 > Consider the necessity for pharmaceutical tetanus prophylaxis
 > Prepare haemostatic gauze and a tourniquet (if applicable)

PREPARATION
 *I'd done a sterile pair of nitrile gloves*
 *I'd assess the location, size, and depth of the embedded object*
 *I'd prepare a sterile scalpel and MaGills forceps*
 *I'd sterilise the surrounding area with a 2% chlorhexidine wipe*

OBJECT REMOVAL
 *I'd grasp the object with the forceps*
 *I'd gently pull on the object whilst rotating it back and forth*
 > If the object cannot be easily removed:
    > Carefully cut away the tissue surrounding the object
    > If and when haemorrhaging occurs, apply direct pressure with sterile gauze
    > If necessary, provide further local anaesthesia / analgesia
 *I'd assess the wound for bleeding, infection, or any other complications*
 *I'd irrigate the site with Normal Saline Solution*
 *I'd apply a sterile gauze pad over the site*
 *I'd secure the gauze with a cotton bandage*
 *I'd tie the bandage and cut off any excess*
