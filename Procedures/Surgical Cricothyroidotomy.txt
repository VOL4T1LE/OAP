##################

PATIENT PREPARATION
 *I'd locate the incision site*
 *I'd sterilise the site with a 2% Chlorhexidine wipe*
 *I'd allow the site to dry*
 *I'd get 5mL of 1% Lidocaine Hydrochloride in a 5mL syringe*
 *I'd ensure no impurities were present in the solution*
 *I'd infiltrate the local anaesthetic at the insertion site*
 *I'd ensure that the patient was in a supine position*
 *I'd put on a clean pair of nitrile gloves*

SITE IDENTIFICATION
 *I'd identify relevant anatomical sites*
 *I'd palpate the thyroid cartilage*
 *I'd palpate the cricoid cartilage*
 *I'd palpate the cricothyroid membrane*
 *I'd stabilise the site with my first and third non-dominant digits*
 *I'd palpate the membrane with my non-dominant index finger*

SURGICAL INCISION AND DILATIOM
 *I'd get a #11 blade scalpel*
 *I'd make a midline vertical incision over the cricothyroid membrane*
 *I'd extend the incision to a length and depth of 3cm*
 > A midline vertical incision may lead to some venous bleeding
 > This type of incision however, avoids the laterally located vascalature of the neck
 *I'd palpate the cricothyroid membrane through the incision using my non-dominant index finger*
 *I'd make a horizontal incision through the membrane*
 > A distinct pop will be heard as you pierce the membrane and enter the trachea
 *I'd keep the scalpel in place until the tracheal hook is inserted*
 *I'd insert a tracheal hook at the superior end of the incision*
 *I'd retract the skin and membrane cephalad*
 > If patient is apnoeic, apply pressure to anterior chest wall to simulate exhalation and thereby produce air bubbles
 *I'd get the trousseau dilator*
 *I'd hold it in my non-dominant hand*
 *I'd dilate the incision vertically*

INTUBATION AND VENTILATION
 *I'd insert the tracheostomy tube between the two blades of the dilator*
 *I'd direct the tube to one side of the patient*
 *I'd advance until the tube is through the membrane*
 *I'd rotate the tube 90 degrees*
 *I'd insert the the tube caudally*
 *I'd remove the tracheostomy tube obturator*
 *I'd insert the inner cannula into the tracheostomy tube*
 *I'd lock the inner cannula in place*
 *I'd inflate the balloon with a 5mL syringe of air*
 *I'd connect the tube to a BVM*
 *I'd begin manually ventilating via the BVM*

CONFIRMATION OF PLACEMENT
 *I'd assess the chest to see if it rises during ventilation*
 *I'd auscultate the lungs to confirm placement*

CAPNOGRAPHY
 *I'd briefly stop ventilating*
 *I'd connect a capnography sensor to the tube*
 *I'd connect the BVM and continue ventilating*
 *I'd connect the sensor to the LIFEPAK 15*
 *I'd assess the patient's End Tidal CO2 waveform*

UPON CONFIRMATION OF CORRECT PLACEMENT
 *I'd remove the tracheal hook*
 *I'd secure the tube in place*
