SpO2, SpCO, SpMet ASSESSMENT
 *I'd get a suitably-sized reusable rainbow sensor*
 *I'd connect the rainbow sensor's cable to the sensor cable port on the LIFEPAK 15*
 *I'd identify the index finger with the best perfusion*
 *I'd orient the sensor so that the cable is on the back of the patient's hand*
 *I'd place the sensor on the patient's index finger*
 > The non-dominant index finger is preferred
 > Ensure that the patient's fingertip reaches the raised digit stop in the sensor
 *I'd wait for the sensor to get a reading*
 *I'd assess the patient's blood oxygen saturation levels on the LIFEPAK 15*
