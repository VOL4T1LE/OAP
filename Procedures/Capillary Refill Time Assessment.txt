CRT ASSESSMENT
 *I'd abduct the patients arm*
 *I'd apply pressure to one of the patient's digits*
 *I'd maintain firm pressure for around ten seconds*
 > The skin should now appear noticably pale
 > This colour change occurs due to oxygen-rich blood filling up empty capillaries
 *I'd release pressure*
 *I'd time how long the skin takes to revert to its normal colour*

END OF PROCEDURE
