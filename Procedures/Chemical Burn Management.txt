PREREQUISITES (CHEMICAL CONTAMINATION)
 > Adopt "look, don't touch" principles unless patient contact is necessary
 > Ensure the following PPE is adorned before coming into contact with any contaminated patients:
    > Long Sleeve Gown
    > Eye Protection (Face Visor, etc)
    > FFP Class 3 Mask
    > Gloves
 > Remove any contaminated clothing or jewellery
 > Do not remove contaminated items of clothing over the patient's head, instead, cut them off

CHEMICAL BURN MANAGEMENT
 *I'd carefully remove any dry chemical debris*
 *I'd get some cold Normal Saline Solution*
 *I'd irrigate the site of the chemical burns*
 > Ensure that the cleansing liquid used is allowed to run off the skin and does not pool
 > Ideally, the patient should be immersed in cold running water for ~20 minutes in a decontamination shower
 *I'd get a sterile dressing*
 *I'd lightly dress the site of the chemical burns*
 > Pack lightly as to not put excess pressure on the site
