PREREQUISITIES
 > Preoxygenation via NRBM, outlined later on

ETTI INDICATIONS
 > Risk of gastric aspiration
 > Impending airway compromise
 > Risk of airway compromise due to constriction

PRE-ETTI CHECKS
 *I'd ensure the light bulb on the laryngoscope blade is working*
 *I'd ensure that the patient is connected to all necessary monitoring equipment*
	> Blood Oxygen Saturation by Pulse Oximetry

EQUIPMENT PREPARATION
 *I'd connect a laryngscope handle to an appropriately sized blade*
 *I'd get a 7.5mm endotracheal tube*
 > ET Tube size may be calculated as follows:
	> Age of patient, divided by 4
	> Add 4 to get the size of an uncuffed ETT
	> Minus 1 half to get the size of a cuffed ETT
	> Multiply final ETT size by 3 to get the depth
 *I'd ensure that the ETT cuff doesn't leak*
 *I'd deflate the ETT's cuff*
 *I'd prepare a bougie*

PREOXYGENATION
 *I'd preoxygenate patient with an NRBM*
 *I'd connect the NRBM to an oxygen tank*
 *I'd open the valve and set oxygen flow to 12LPM*
 *I'd preoxygenate for 3-5 minutes whilst drawing up medications*
 > Preoxygenation via 100% oxygen NRBM is to be done without positive pressure ventilation
	> Positive pressure ventilation = Air pushed into the lungs [E.g the squeezing of a BVM]
	> Negative pressure ventilation = Air pulled into the lungs [E.g natural inspiration]
 > Only preoxygenate via BVM if an SpO2 of >90% cannot be achieved normally

ETT INTUBATION
 *I'd remove the NRBM*
 *I'd lift the patient's chin up and tilt their head*
 *I'd insert the laryngoscope into the right side of the patient's mouth*
 *I'd sweep the patient's tongue to the left*
 *I'd visualise the epiglottis and rotate 45 degrees up*
 *I'd visualise the patient's vocal cords*
 *I'd advance the bougie past the vocal cords*
 *I'd advance the bougie into the trachea*
 *I'd place the ETT over the bougie*
 *I'd advance the ETT over the bougie and into the trachea*
 *I'd carefully retract the laryngoscope*
 *I'd slowly retract the bougie*
 *I'd inflate the ETT's cuff with a syringe of air*

VENTILATION
 *I'd connect a bag-valve mask to the ET tube*
 *I'd begin manually ventilating the patient via the BVM*
 *I'd auscultate the patient's lungs to verify the presence of bilateral air entry*
 > Confirm that the ETTI was successful and still allows airflow into the lungs
