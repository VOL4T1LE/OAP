PREREQUISITES
 > At least one Peripheral Intravenous Line
 > supplemental Oxygen Therapy should be underway
 > The following patient vitals should be monitored on a LIFEPAK 15:
	> Heart Rhythm
	> Heart Rate
	> Capillary Blood Oxygen Saturation

PATIENT POSITIONING
 *I'd position the patient in a semirecumbent position at a 30 degree angle*
 > A supine position is an acceptable alternative

MARKING INSERTION SITE & ASEPSIS
 *I'd identify the xiphoid process*
 *I'd identify the right and left fifth intercostal spaces*
 *I'd make a left sternocostal margin as an insertion site*
 *I'd sterilise the subxiphoid area with a 2% Chlorhexidine wipe*
 *I'd don a new clean pair of nitrile gloves*

INFILTRATION
 *I'd get 5mL of 1% Lidocaine Hydrochloride in a 5mL syringe*
 *I'd ensure no impurities were present in the solution*
 *I'd infiltrate the local anaesthetic at the insertion site*
 > First create a skin wheal, then infiltrate the subcutaneous fat and deeper tissues

PUNCTURING INSERTION SITE
 *I'd get a sterile #11 blade scalpel*
 *I'd puncture the site between the xiphoid process and left sternocostal margin*

NEEDLE PREPARATION
 *I'd connect a 60mL syringe to a spinal needle*
 *I'd aspirate 5mL of Normal Saline Solution into the syringe*
 > While advancing the needle, occasional injection of 1mL of Normal Saline Solution may ensure the needle lumen remains patent
 > If time permits, connect an alligator clip from the base of the spinal needle to the V1 Lead of the ECG

NEEDLE INSERTION
 *I'd insert the needle through the skin incision*
 *I'd direct the needle towards the left shulder*
 *I'd occasionally inject 1mL of Normal Saline Solution to maintain needle lumen patency*
 > Maintain the needle at a 45 degree angle to the abdominal wall and 45 degrees off the midline sagittal plane
 > If time permits it, you should perform this procedure with guidance from an eFAST Ultrasound Device

PENETRATION OF THE MYOCARDIUM
 *I'd slowly advance the spinal needle to around 5cm deep*
 *I'd do so while applying negative pressure*
 > Continue advancing until one of the following criteria is met:
	> A return of fluid is visualised
	> Cardiac pulsations are palpable
	> An abrupt change in the ECG waveform is noticed
 > If the ECG waveform shows an injury pattern (ST-segment Elevation) then,
	> Slowly retract the needle until the pattern returns to normal
	> This pattern suggests that the needle is in direct contact with the myocardium

ASPIRATION OF FLUIDS
 *I'd withdraw as much fluid as possible*
 *I'd stabilise the needle against the patient's torso*
 *I'd remove the fluid-filled syringe and replace it with another 60mL syringe*
 *I'd attempt to aspirate more pericardial fluid*
 > Repeat the previous steps depending on how much fluid is in the pericardium
 *I'd retract the needle and dispose of it into a sharps container*
 > As more pericardial fluid is aspirated, the needle may move closer to the heart, causing an injury pattern
	> If this injury pattern is visualised on the ECG, proceed as previously mentioned, by slowly retracting the needle a bit
