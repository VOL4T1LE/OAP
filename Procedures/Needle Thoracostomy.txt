##################

PREREQUISITES
 > At least one Peripheral Intravenous Line
 > For conscious patients, consider analgesia and anxiolysis

PATIENT PREPARATION
 *I'd ensure that the patient was in a supine position*
 > This implies an axillary approach
 *I'd draw up 10mg of Morphine Sulphate*
 *I'd ensure no impurities were present*
 *I'd connect the syringe to the pIV line*
 *I'd inject the 10mg of Morphine Sulphate*
 *I'd remove the patient's shirt*
 > May be cut with trauma sheers in emergency conditions

CONFIRMATION OF PLEURAL EFFUSION / PNEUMOTHORAX
 *I'd get an eFAST Ultrasound Device*
 *I'd apply ultrasound transmission gel to the probe*
 *I'd apply some gel to the patient's chest*
 *I'd scan the upper and lower thoracic cavity*
 > Assess ultrasound scan for the following:
	> Affected hemithorax
	> Location and size of effusion
	> Amount of fluid involved
	> Location of diaphragm at end-exhalation
 > The diaphragm is echogenic, and should be easily identifiable via ultrasound
 > Make sure to select a rib interspace into which the diaphragm does not rise up at end-exhalation

SITE PREPARATION
 *I'd locate the mid clavicular line*
 *I'd locate the 2nd intercostal space*
 *I'd sterilise the area with a 2% Chlorhexidine wipes*
 *I'd allow the site to dry*
 *I'd mark the insertion site*
 > If the patient has loose skin or significant subcutaneous tissue:
	> Use tape to pull the skin or subcutaneous tissue out of the way
	> Mark and use an optimised insertion site

LOCAL INFILTRATION
 *I'd get 20mL of 1% Lidocaine Hydrochloride in a 20mL syringe*
 *I'd ensure no impurities were present in the solution*
 *I'd guide infiltration via the eFAST point of care ultrasound device*
 *I'd infiltrate the skin*
 *I'd infiltrate the subcutaneous tissue*
 *I'd infiltrate the rib periosteum*
 *I'd infiltrate the intercostal muscles*
 *I'd infiltrate the parietal pleura*

NEEDLE THORACOSTOMY
 *I'd get a catheter with a 14g needle*
 *I'd advance the catheter through the skin*
 *I'd advance the catheter over the superior aspect of the rib*
 *I'd advance until pleural fluid is aspirated*
 > The neurovascular bundle is at the inferior border of the rib and should be avoided
 *I'd thread the catheter without advancing the needle*
 *I'd securely hold the catheter and retract the needle*
 *I'd dispose of the needle into a sharps container*
 *I'd fashion a syringe pump and connect it to the catheter*
 *I'd drain the pleural effusion*
 > Following completion:
	> The catheter should be carefully removed
	> The site should be dressed
