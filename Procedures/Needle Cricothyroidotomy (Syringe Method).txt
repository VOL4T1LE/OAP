PATIENT PREPARATION
 *I'd locate the incision site*
 *I'd sterilise the site with a 2% Chlorhexidine wipe*
 *I'd allow the site to dry*
 *I'd get 5mL of 1% Lidocaine Hydrochloride in a 5mL syringe*
 *I'd ensure no impurities were present in the solution*
 *I'd infiltrate the local anaesthetic at the insertion site*
 *I'd ensure that the patient was in a supine position*
 *I'd put on a clean pair of nitrile gloves*

SITE IDENTIFICATION
 *I'd identify relevant anatomical sites*
 *I'd palpate the thyroid cartilage*
 *I'd palpate the cricoid cartilage*
 *I'd palpate the cricothyroid membrane*
 *I'd stabilise the site with my first and third non-dominant digits*
 *I'd palpate the membrane with my non-dominant index finger*

SURGICAL INCISION AND DILATIOM
 *I'd get a syringe full of Normal Saline Solution*
 *I'd connect the syringe to an angiographic catheter*
 *I'd hold the angiographic catheter with my dominant hand*
 *I'd insert the angiographic catheter into the cricothyroid membrane*
 *I'd direct it caudally at a 45 degree angle*
 *I'd apply negative pressure to the syringe as the needle advances*
 > A distinct pop can be felt as the needle traverses the membrane and enters the trachea
 > In addition, air bubbles will appear in the fluid-filled syringe

OXYGEN CYLINDER/SYSTEM CONNECTION
 *I'd get the barrel of a 3mL syringe*
 *I'd connect it to the catheter*
 *I'd place an endotracheal tube adapter*
 *I'd attach a BVM and begin manually ventilating*

CONFIRMATION OF PLACEMENT
 *I'd assess the chest to see if it rises during ventilation*
 *I'd auscultate the lungs to confirm placement*

CAPNOGRAPHY
 *I'd briefly stop ventilating*
 *I'd connect a capnography sensor*
 *I'd reattach the BVM and continue ventilating*
 *I'd connect the sensor to the LIFEPAK 15*
 *I'd assess the patient's End Tidal CO2 waveform*
