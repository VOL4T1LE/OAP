PATIENT PREPARATION
 *I'd ensure that the patient was in a supine position*
 *I'd position the patient's head and neck in a neutral position*
 > Ensure that the patient's airway is clear of any secretions or obstructions

LMA PREPARATION
 *I'd select an appropriately-sized Larynegal Mask Airway*
 > This is based on a patient's:
    > Age
    > Weight
    > Gender
 *I'd ensure that the LMA cuff is fully inflated*
 *I'd ensure that the pilot balloon isn't leaking*
 *I'd deflate the cuff entirely using a 60cc syringe*
 *I'd lubricate the LMA cuff with a water-soluble lubricant*

LMA INSERTION
 *I'd hold the LMA with my dominant hand*
 *I'd open the patient's mouth with my non-dominant hand*
 *I'd ensure the concave surface of the LMA is facing downwards*
 *I'd insert the LMA and direct it towards the glottis*
 *I'd advance slowly until resistance is felt*
 *I'd inflate the LMA cuff with a syringe of air*

CONFIRMATION OF PLACEMENT
 *I'd get a laryngoscope blade and connect it to a handle*
 *I'd insert the laryngoscope into the patient's mouth*
 *I'd ensure the LMA was placed correctly in the hypopharynx*
 *I'd ensure that the LMA isn't obstructing the glottis*
