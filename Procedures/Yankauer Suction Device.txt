AIRWAY SUCTION
 *I'd get a yankauer suction catheter*
 *I'd expose the device's connection port from the packaging*
 *I'd ensure the catheter is connected to the suction tubing*
 *I'd adjust suction pressure to 90mmHg*
 *I'd test for adequate suction by occluding the catheter's side port*
 *I'd remove the catheter from the packaging*
 *I'd keep the side port open and insert the catheter's tip into the PT's oral cavity*
 *I'd suction the airway*
 *I'd slowly withdraw the catheter*
