PREPARATION
 *I'd get a 2% Chlorhexidine wipe*
 *I'd sterilise the patient's finger with the wipe*
 *I'd allow the site to dry*
 *I'd get a glucometer and turn it on*
 *I'd ensure the device was calibrated*
 *I'd load a test strip into the glucometer*
 *I'd get a lancet and remove the protective cap*

BGL MEASUREMENT
 *I'd prick the side of the patient's finger with the lancet*
 > Gently squeeze the finger from proximal to distal to produce a droplet of blood
 *I'd gently touch the test strip with the patients finger*
 > Ensure that the test strip, inserted in the bottom of the glucometer, absorbs the droplet of blood
 *I'd apply some gauze to the site and maintain pressure*
 *I'd discard the lancet into a sharps container*
 *I'd assess the BGL reading on the glucometer*
 *I'd discard the used test strip into a clinical waste container*
