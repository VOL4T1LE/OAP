PREREQUISITES
 > Ensure that the skin of the patient's chest is exposed
 > Shave excess hair follicles in a 2cm diameter around the desired electrode site(s)
 > Using a 2% Chlorhexidine wipe, abrade desired electrode sites to remove loose skin, body oil, sweat, etc
 > Allow sites to dry before placing electrodes

LEAD PLACEMENT
 *I'd remove 3 electrodes connected to an ECG Leadwire from the pack*
 *I'd ensure all electrodes were still conductive*
 *I'd identify the suprasternal notch*
 *I'd place the RA electrode inferior to the right clavicle at the midclavicular line*
 *I'd place the LA electrode bilaterally to the RA electrode*
 *I'd ensure both electrodes were in full contact with the skin*
 *I'd identify the 7th intercostal space*
 *I'd place the unipolar LL electrode left of the midclavicular line at the 7th ICS*
 *I'd ensure the electrode is in full contact with the skin*

ECG ACQUISITION & INTERPRETATION
 *I'd assess bipolar Leads I to III*
 *I'd assess the morphology of the rhythm displayed*
 *I'd interpret the ECG measurement*
