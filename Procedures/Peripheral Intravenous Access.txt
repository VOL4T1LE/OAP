PREPARATION
 *I'd get a tourniquet from the cannulation pack*
 *I'd grab a 2% Chlorhexidine wipe*
 *I'd get a 18g cannula*
 *I'd put on a clean pair of nitrile gloves*
 *I'd apply a proximal tourniquet around the patient's arm to promote venous distention*
 *I'd look for a prominent vessel in the antecubital fossa*
 *I'd palpate the vessel, to ensure its not an artery*
 *I'd sterilise the injection site with a 2% Chlorhexidine wipe*
 *I'd allow the site to dry*
 *I'd remove the needle safety cap and discard it*
 *I'd ensure the catheter is seated back in the notch*

CANNULATION
 *I'd place my thumb below the cannulation site*
 *I'd swiftly enter the vein at a 30 degree angle*
 *I'd await flashback*
 *Upon flashback I'd lower the catheter*
 *I'd advance the needle assembly slightly*
 *I'd ensure the needle assembly is stable, and flick the catheter into the vein*
 *I'd apply light distal pressure to the catheter and stabilise the hub*
 *I'd release and remove the tourniquet*
 *I'd retract the needle, disposing of it in a sharps container*
 *I'd attach a needle-free valve*
 *I'd connect a line to the connector*
 *I'd flush the line with 10cc's Normal Saline Solution*

EXAMINING PATENCY
 *I'd examine the pIV line*
 *I'd get some Tegaderm*
 *I'd apply the Tegaderm over the catheter*
 *I'd secure the line with some tape*
