PREQUISITES
 > Perform a modified Allen's test before utilising the radial artery
 > Note whether the patient is receiving Oxygen Therapy
 > Note oxygen flow rate and delivery method if applicable

PREPARATION
 *I'd position the PT's non-dominant hand at 20-30 degrees with the wrist extended*
 *I'd palpate the PT's radial artery*
 *I'd identify a distal site at which the artery is most pulsatile*
 *I'd wipe the site with a 2% Chlorhexidine wipe*
 *I'd allow the site to dry*
 *I'd pre-fill a syringe with Heparin*
 *I'd connect the pre-Heparinised syringe to an ABG needle*
 *I'd get a 3mL syringe of 1% Lidocaine Hydrochloride*
 *I'd ensure no impurities were present in the solution*
 *I'd anaesthetise the site via local infiltration*

ABG SAMPLE COLLECTION
 *I'd remove the protective cover from the ABG needle*
 *I'd hold the needle like a dart*
 *I'd insert the needle at 3-45 degrees*
 *I'd advanced until flashback occurs and less resistance is felt*
 *I'd wait for the syringe to fill in a pulsatile manner*
 *I'd retract the needle and firmly apply a gauze pad*
 *I'd secure the gauze with some tape and continue applying pressure*
 *I'd engage the needle safety device and then remove the needle*
 *I'd discard the needle into a sharps container*
 *I'd attach a cap to the ABG sample*

DEVICE SETUP
 *I'd get the Abbott i-STAT ABG Analyser*
 *I'd select option 2: "i-STAT cartridge"*
 *I'd input the operator ID*
 *I'd input and confirm the patient ID*
 *I'd scan the cartridge lot number*

POINT OF CARE ABG ASSESSMENT
 *I'd remove the cartridge from the sealed packaging and open it*
 *I'd roll the sample vertically and horizontally between the palms of my hands*
 *I'd take discard the first few drops of the sample*
 *I'd fill the cartridge with the blood sample until the indicated mark*
 *I'd close the cartridge*
 *I'd insert the cartridge through the bottom of the i-STAT analyser*

ANALYSIS PARAMETERS
 > Blood Acidity (pH)
 > Partial Pressure of Carbon Dioxide (PCO2 in mmHg)
 > Partial Pressure of Oxygen (PO2 in mmHg)
 > Base Excess Extracellular Fluid (BEecf in mmol/L)
 > Blood Bicarbonate Concentration (HCO3 in mmol/L)
 > Total Blood Carbon Dioxide (TCO2 in mmol/L)
 > Arterial Blood Oxygen Saturation (SaO2 in %)
