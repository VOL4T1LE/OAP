PREREQUISITES
 > At least one available large-bore (16-18 gauge) Peripheral Intravenous Line
 > Ensure the availability of universal donor, or patient-compatible blood products
 > Active monitoring of cardiac vital signs via a LIFEPAK 15 monitor

PATIENT PREPARATION
 > Assess the patient for any indications of haemodynamic instability or active haemorrhaging
 *I'd expose the patient's arm for blood transfusion*
 *I'd place a proximal tourniquet round the patient's arm*
 > This is done to promote venous distension
 *I'd select an appropriate site for venipuncutre*
 > This is typically:
    > The Antecubital Fossa
    > The Dorsal Vein
 *I'd sterilise the chosen insertion site with a 2% chlorhexidine wipe*
 *I'd allow the site to dry*

PROCEDURE PREPARATION
 *I'd get a pack of O- blood product*
 *I'd inspect the pack for any impurities*
 > These would include:
    > Discolouration
    > Clots
    > Any other abnormalities
 *I'd label the blood product with the patient's name, blood group, and the expiration time of the pack*
 *I'd get a blood administration set with a filter*
 *I'd remove the protective cover from the spike*
 *I'd ensure the clamp on the blood transfusion tubing is closed*
 *I'd spike the blood product pack's access port*
 *I'd prime the administration set with Normal Saline solution*
 *I'd ensure no air bubbles were present in the blood transfusion tubing*

CONSIDERATIONS
 > Remember that Saline is the only solution that can be transfused with blood products
 > Therefore, consider the necessity of another Peripheral Intravenous Line for concomitant pharmacotherapy

BLOOD TRANSFUSION
 *I'd connect the blood transfusion tubing to the pIV line hub*
 *I'd ensure the BTT was securely connected to the hub*
 *I'd open the clamp on the administration set to initiate blood transfusion*
 > Observe the initial few millilitres of blood for indications of transfusion reactions, for example:
    > Haemolysis
    > Gas bubbles
 *I'd adjust the flow rate of blood transfusion appropriately*
