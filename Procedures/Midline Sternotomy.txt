 *I'd mark at the sternal notch*
 *I'd mark a few centimetres below the xiphoid process*
 *I'd connect both points with a marker*

PREPARATION
 *I'd prepare a pneumatic sternal saw*
 *I'd prepare a pair of sternal retractors*
 *I'd prepare internal defibrillator paddles*
 *I'd prepare a set of scalpels*
 *I'd don a clean pair of nitrile gloves*
 *I'd ensure the patient was supine*

INDUCTION OF GENERAL ANAESTHESIA
 *I'd measure up 320mg of Sodium Thiopental*
 *I'd ensure no impurities were present*
 *I'd connect the syringe to the extension set*
 *I'd push the 320mg of Sodium Thiopental via pIV*
 *I'd measure up 15mg of Rocuronium Hydrochloride*
 *I'd ensure no impurities were present*
 *I'd connect the syringe to the extension set*
 *I'd push the 15mg of Rocuronium Hydrochloride via pIV*

MIDLINE STERNOTOMY
 *I'd get a #22 scalpel*
 *I'd make an incision between the sternal notch and angle of Louis*
 *I'd extend the incision up to and below the xiphoid process*
 *I'd get a #10 scalpel*
 *I'd make another incision through the subcutaneous tissue*
 *I'd incise down to the sternum*
 *I'd separate the sternal periosteum, being careful not to strip the periosteum*
 *I'd get an electro cauterizer*
 *I'd cauterize any sites of significant haemorrhaging*
 *I'd divide the interclavicular ligament at the sternal notch*
 *I'd get the pneumatic sternal saw*
 *I'd divide the sternum from top to bottom*
 *I'd identify the brachial plexus*
