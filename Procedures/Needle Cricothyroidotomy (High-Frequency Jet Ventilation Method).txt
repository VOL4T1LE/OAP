PATIENT PREPARATION
 *I'd locate the incision site*
 *I'd sterilise the site with a 2% Chlorhexidine wipe*
 *I'd allow the site to dry*
 *I'd get 5mL of 1% Lidocaine Hydrochloride in a 5mL syringe*
 *I'd ensure no impurities were present in the solution*
 *I'd infiltrate the local anaesthetic at the insertion site*
 *I'd ensure that the patient was in a supine position*
 *I'd put on a clean pair of nitrile gloves*

SITE IDENTIFICATION
 *I'd identify relevant anatomical sites*
 *I'd palpate the thyroid cartilage*
 *I'd palpate the cricoid cartilage*
 *I'd palpate the cricothyroid membrane*
 *I'd stabilise the site with my first and third non-dominant digits*
 *I'd palpate the membrane with my non-dominant index finger*

SURGICAL INCISION AND DILATIOM
 *I'd get a syringe full of Normal Saline Solution*
 *I'd connect the syringe to an angiographic catheter*
 *I'd hold the angiographic catheter with my dominant hand*
 *I'd insert the angiographic catheter into the cricothyroid membrane*
 *I'd direct it caudally at a 45 degree angle*
 *I'd apply negative pressure to the syringe as the needle advances*
 > A distinct pop can be felt as the needle traverses the membrane and enters the trachea
 > In addition, air bubbles will appear in the fluid-filled syringe

HIGH FREQUENCY JET VENTILATION (HFJV)
 *I'd connect a patient connection tube to the jet ventilation device*
 *I'd connect an airway pressure tube to the device under the "Proximal" connection*
 *I'd connect the patient connection tube to a luer connector*
 *I'd connect the airway pressure tube to the luer lock connector*
 *I'd press and hold the "start/stop" button on the device*
 *I'd press the "alarm reset" button*
 *I'd set oxygen flow to 15LPM*

CONFIRMATION OF PLACEMENT
 *I'd assess the chest to see if it rises during ventilation*
 *I'd auscultate the lungs to confirm placement*
