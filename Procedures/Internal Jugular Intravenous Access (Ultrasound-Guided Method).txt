PREPARATION
 *I'd put on a clean pair of nitrile gloves*
 *I'd ensure that the patient was in a supine position*
 *I'd tilt the PT's head back by 20 degrees to distend the IJV*
 *I'd slightly turn the patient's head to better expose the IJV*
 *I'd sterilise the site with a 2% Chlorhexidine wipe*
 *I'd allow for the site to dry*

PROCEDURE PREPARATION
 *I'd grab the eFAST point of care ultrasound device*
 *I'd apply contact gel to the device*
 *I'd apply some contact gel to the site*
 *I'd analyse the anatomy of the insertion site*
 *I'd get a #11 scalpel*
 *I'd get a triple-lumen catheter*
 *I'd flush each catheter lumen with 10cc's of Normal Saline Solution*
 *I'd prepare a guide wire by straightening the curved wire tip*
 *I'd scan the insertion site with the POCUS*
 *I'd attempt to compress the Right Carotid Artery*
 *I'd identify the Right External Carotid Artery*
 *I'd compress the Right Internal Jugular Vein*
 *I'd identify the Right Internal Jugular Vein*
 *I'd align the injection to the centre of the ultrasound's screen*
 *I'd get a 5mL syringe with a 25g needle*
 *I'd draw up 5mL of 1% Lidocaine Hydrochloride with the syringe*
 *I'd ensure no impurities were present in the solution*
 *I'd anaesthetise the site with the 1% Lidocaine Hydrochloride*

GUIDEWIRE INTRODUCTION
 *I'd get a 16g introducer syringe*
 *I'd stabilise the site with my nondominant hand*
 *I'd insert the needle under ultrasound guidance*
 *I'd advance the needle towards the vein*
 *I'd pierce the vein wall with the needle, entering the lumen*
 *I'd await a flashback of venous blood in the barrel of the syringe*
 *I'd hold the syringe in place*
 *I'd carefully rotate the introducer syringe*
 *I'd ensure that the bevel of the needle now faces medially*
 *I'd insert the J-curved end of the guidewire facing medially*
 *I'd smoothly advance the guidewire around 10-15cm*
 *I'd securely hold the guidewire distal to the needle*
 *I'd retract the needle*
 *I'd dispose of the needle into a sharps container*

INCISION DILATION
 *I'd get the #11 scalpel*
 *I'd extend the insertion site with a 4mm incision*
 *I'd advance the tissue dilator over the guidewire*
 *I'd use a corkscrew motion to fully insert the dilator*
 *I'd retract the dilator*
 *I'd maintain my grasp of the guidewire*

CANNULATION
 *I'd advance the catheter over the guidewire*
 *I'd thread the catheter tip over the distal end of the guidewire*
 *I'd slide the catheter down to the skin surface*
 *I'd carefully advance the catheter hub into the vein*
 *I'd use the POCUS to verify intravenous placement*
 *I'd hold the catheter securely in place*
 *I'd retract the guidewire*
 *I'd clear the line with 20cc's of Normal Saline Solution*

SUTURING & DRESSING APPLICATION
 *I'd suture the skin to the mounting clip on the catheter*
 *I'd suture the catheter at another site to prevent pulling on the insertion site*
 *I'd apply a sterile occlusive dressing over the site*
