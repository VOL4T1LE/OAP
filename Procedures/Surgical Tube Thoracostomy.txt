PREREQUISITES
 > At least one Peripheral Intravenous Line

PATIENT PREPARATION
 *I'd ensure the patient is supine*
 > Elevating the patient lessens the risk of diaphragm elevation
 > This decreases the risk of consequently misplacing the chest tube into the abdominal space
 *I'd abduct the arm on the affected side*
 *I'd elevate the arm and rotate it externally*
 *I'd simulate a position in which the palm is behind the patient's head*

PREPARATION OF THE DRAINAGE SYSTEM
 *I'd cut clothes at the site with trauma shears*
 *I'd get a thoracostomy tube with connectors*
 *I'd get a laerdal suction unit*
 *I'd connect a water seal to the LSU*

PLEURAL EFFUSION IDENTIFICATION
 *I'd auscultate the patient's lungs*
 *I'd identify the affected hemithorax*
 *I'd identify the 5th intercostal space*
 *I'd identify the mid-axillary line*
 *I'd mark two intersecting lines at both sites*

ADMINISTRATION OF OPIOID ANALGESIC
 *I'd draw up 20mg of Morphine Sulphate*
 *I'd ensure no impurities were present in the solution*
 *I'd connect the syringe to the pIV line*
 *I'd push the 20mg of Morphine Sulphate*

LOCAL INFILTRATION
 *I'd get 20mL of 1% Lidocaine Hydrochloride in a 20mL syringe*
 *I'd ensure no impurities were present in the solution*
 *I'd infiltrate 5mL into the skin overlying the insertion site*
 *I'd infiltrate 5mL into the subcutaneous fat superior to the insertion site*
 *I'd inject 10mL into the periosteum, intercostal muscles, and pleura*
 > Aspiration of air, blood, and/or pus into the syringe confirms that the needle has entered the pleural cavity

CREATION OF INCISION
 *I'd get a #11 blade scalpel*
 *I'd locate the rib below the desired intercostal level of entry*
 *I'd make a 4cm long incision into the skin overlying the rib*
 *I'd get a haemostat*
 *I'd bluntly dissect a tract in the subcutaneous fat*
 *I'd palpate the tract with my finger*
 *I'd ensure the tract ends at the upper border of the rib above the incision*

FURTHER LOCAL INFILTRATION
 *I'd get 5mL of 1% Lidocaine Hydrochloride in a 5mL syringe*
 *I'd ensure no impurities were present in the solution*
 *I'd infiltrate 5mL into the intercostal muscles and pleura*

KELLY CLAMP INSERTION
 *I'd get a closed large kelly clamp*
 *I'd pass through the intercostal muscles and parietal pleura*
 *I'd enter the pleural cavity*
 *I'd open the kelly clamp*
 *I'd retract the opened kelly clamp, enlarging the dissected tract*
 *I'd measure the length between the incision and the apex of the lung*

CHEST TUBE INSERTION
 *I'd get a large kelly clamp*
 *I'd grasp the proximal (fenestrated) end of the chest tube*
 *I'd introduce the tube through the tract and into the thoracic cavity*
 *I'd release the kelly clamp*
 *I'd advance the tube posteriorly and superiorly*
 *I'd ensure that all of the fenestrated holes in the tube are inside the thoracic cavity*
 *I'd connect the chest tube to the LSU*
 *I'd release the cross clamp on the chest tube*

SUTURING THE INCISION SITE
 *I'd grab some suturing equipment*
 *I'd use a needle driver to grab a needle and clamp it into the driver*
 *I'd straighten and line up both edges of the incision*
 *I'd push the needle through the skin at a 90 degree angle*
 *I'd create a central vertical mattress suture*
 *I'd cut excess thread with the driver*

POST-INSERTION TREATMENT
 *I'd place petroleum gauze over the incision site*
 *I'd cut 4x4 gauze pads into Y-shaped fenestrated gauze*
 *I'd secure the gauzes to the chest wall with adhesive tape*
 *I'd secure the chest tube with adhesive tape*

CONFIRMATION OF PLACEMENT
 *I'd observe the patient's thorax*
 *I'd see if the chest rises upon inspiration*
 *I'd auscultate the affected hemithorax*
