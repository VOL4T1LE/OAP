PREREQUISITES
 > At least one Peripheral Intravenous Line
 > Necessary staff and equipment to perform a simple blood transfusion

PREREQUISITE CRITERIA
 > Ensure that most if not all the necessary criteria for emergency amputation are met:
    > The patient consents to emergency amputation (if conscious and possessing capacity)
    > All other primary rescue methods have been considered
    > Other means of extrication would exceed a reasonable time frame, resulting in the death of the patient
    > The patient presents with a mutilated, unsalvageable extremity prolonging extrication and/or evacuation
    > The extremities of a deceased patient are obstructing access to (potentially) living patients

SITE IDENTIFICATION
 *I'd assess the extremity*
 > Remove any clothing covering the extremity via regular means or via trauma shears
 *I'd identify the most distal site possible*
 *I'd mark the site for surgical transection*

PREPARATION
 *I'd ensure that the patient was in a supine position*
 *I'd prepare some cotton bandages, haemostatic gauze, and a laparotomy pad*
 *I'd prepare some Cellox clotting agent*
 *I'd prepare some kelly clamps and some haemostats*
 *I'd apply a proximal tourniquet*
 > Do not place tourniquets over joints or bony prominances
 > Consider the application of two tourniquets
 *I'd don a sterile pair of gloves, a gown, a facemask, and some eye protection*

STERILISATION
 *I'd sterilise the site with 2% chlorhexidine solution*
 *I'd allow the site to dry*

INDUCTION OF GENERAL ANAESTHESIA
 *I'd draw up 200mg of Ketamine Hydrochloride*
 *I'd ensure no impurities were present*
 *I'd connect the syringe to the pIV line*
 *I'd infuse the 200mg of Ketamine Hydrochloride over 60 seconds*
 > Consider asking the patient to count backwards from ten
 > Maintenance of anaesthesia/analgesia with 2mg via pIV infusion every minute

ANTIMICROBIAL PROPHYLAXIS
 *I'd draw up 1g of Amoxicillin*
 *I'd ensure no impurities were present*
 *I'd connect the syringe to the pIV line*
 *I'd inject the 1g of Amoxicillin*

GUILLOTINE AMPUTATION
 *I'd get the gigli saw*
 *I'd position the saw at the posterior aspect of the marked extremity*
 > Ask another healthcare professional to stabilise the limb above and below the transection site*
 > The same, or another, should also apply manual pressure to the sites of any major arteries
 *I'd horizontally transect the marked site with the gigli saw*
 *I'd transect towards the anterior aspect of the marked extremity*
 *I'd continue to transect the bone and remaining soft tissue*

HAEMORRHAGE CONTROL
 *I'd identify the exposed blood vessels*
 *I'd clamp each haemorrhaging vessel with a haemostat*
 > If not already performed, consider the application of a second tourniquet
 *I'd get some silk sutures*
 *I'd tie some off each blood vessel with a square knot*
 *I'd unclamp each haemostat*
 > If there is residual bleeding, reclamp the haemostat and tie a stronger knot
 *I'd complete the second throw of each square knot*
 > The procedure of tying off these vessels is known as blood vessel "Ligation"
 *I'd apply a sterile 4x4 gauze pad to the site*
 *I'd wrap the site with a sterile Kerlix gauze bandage roll*
 > Consider the necessity of applying a clotting agent
 > Consider the need for a Simple Blood Transfusion
