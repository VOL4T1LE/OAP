# Operational Aid Program

## ---  Work In Progress  ---

### Disclaimers
1. Users are required to have at least [Version 3.11.1 of Python](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.1/python-3.11.1-amd64.exe) already installed to facilitate the successful execution of the python scripts that make up the program.
2. This program was created, and is being maintained, by a single inexperienced person, therefore the dates of updates and patches may vary significantly and there are likely to be some minor spelling errors and/or bugs.
3. This program is currently only confirmed as being compatible with the Microsoft Windows 10 Operating System
4. Any tampering with the file structure or the files themselves will likely result in undesired behaviour

### Current Functions
- Two search utilities available for over 40 procedures of varying clinical scopes of practice along with over 10 memory aids
- A rudimentary LIFEPAK 15 option, designed to somewhat emulate the display of the aforementioned patient vital sign monitor
