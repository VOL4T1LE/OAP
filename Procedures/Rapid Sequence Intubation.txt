PREREQUISITES
 > At least one Peripheral Intravenous Line
 > Preoxygenation via NRBM, outlined later on

RSI INDICATIONS
 > One of these five criteria must be met:
	> Inability to maintain airway patency
	> Inability to protect airway from aspiration
	> Failure to ventilate
	> Failure to oxygenate
	> Anticipation of a deteriorating course, eventually leading to respiratory failure
 > RSIs are not indicated in patients who are unconscious and apneic (This is called a "Crash" airway)
	> A crash airway indicates the following interventions:
		> Endotracheal intubation without induction or paralysis
		> Immediate BVM ventilation

PRE-RSI CHECKS
 *I'd ensure the light bulb on the laryngoscope blade is working*
 *I'd ensure that the patient is connected to all necessary monitoring equipment*
	> Blood Oxygen Saturation by Pulse Oximetry
	> Continuous End-Tidal CO2 Monitor

EQUIPMENT PREPARATION
 *I'd connect a laryngscope handle to an appropriately sized blade*
 *I'd get a 7.5mm endotracheal tube*
 > ET Tube size may be calculated as follows:
	> Age of patient, divided by 4
	> Add 4 to get the size of an uncuffed ETT
	> Minus 1 half to get the size of a cuffed ETT
	> Multiply final ETT size by 3 to get the depth
 *I'd ensure that the ETT cuff doesn't leak*
 *I'd deflate the ETT's cuff*

PREOXYGENATION
 *I'd preoxygenate patient with an NRBM*
 *I'd connect the NRBM to an oxygen tank*
 *I'd open the valve and set oxygen flow to 12LPM*
 *I'd preoxygenate for 3-5 minutes whilst drawing up medications*
 > Preoxygenation via 100% oxygen NRBM is to be done without positive pressure ventilation
	> Positive pressure ventilation = Air pushed into the lungs [E.g the squeezing of a BVM]
	> Negative pressure ventilation = Air pulled into the lungs [E.g natural inspiration]
 > Only preoxygenate via BVM if an SpO2 of >90% cannot be achieved normally

INDUCTION & PARALYSIS (IA + NMBA)
 *I'd draw up 200mg of 2% Propofol Solution*
 *I'd ensure no impurities were present*
 *I'd connect the syringe to the pIV line*
 *I'd push the 200mg of 2% Propofol Solution*
 *I'd draw up 60mg of Rocuronium Bromide*
 *I'd ensure no impurities were present*
 *I'd connect the syringe to the pIV line*
 *I'd push the 60mg of Rocuronium Bromide*
 > During the administration of the induction agent, if time permits it, you can:
	> Ask the conscious patient to count backwards from 10 to gauge when they are unconscious

ENDOTRACHEAL INTUBATION
 *I'd apply firm pressure over the cricoid cartillage to compress the proximal oesophagus*
 > This is known as the "Sellick Maneuver"
 > Maintain this pressure constantly until after the position of the ETT is verified
 > This manoeuvre is alleged to prevent regurgitation of gastric contents into the lungs
 *I'd remove the NRBM from the patient, setting oxygen flow to zero*
 *I'd insert the laryngoscope into the right side of the patient's oral cavity*
 *I'd sweep the patient's tongue to the left*
 *I'd visualise the epiglottis and rotate 45 degrees up*
 *I'd visualise the vocal cords*
 *I'd grab a bougie*
 *I'd insert the bougie and advance it past the vocal cords*
 *I'd advance the bougie into the trachea*
 *I'd place the ETT over the bougie*
 *I'd advance the ETT over the bougie, into the trachea*
 *I'd retract the laryngoscope*
 *I'd carefully retract the bougie*
 *I'd inflate the ETT's cuff with a 5mL syringe of air*

ETT VERIFICATION
 *I'd assess the patient's end tidal CO2*
 *I'd auscultate the patient's chest to verify placement*
 > Auscultation locations include:
	> Each lateral lung field
	> The left axilla
	> The left supraclavicular region

POSTINTUBATION MANAGEMENT
 *I'd secure the ETT*
 *I'd initiate mechanical ventilation*
 > Administer appropriate analgesics and sedatives to:
	> Ensure patient comfort
	> Decrease O2 demand
	> Decrease ICP
