A fracture in which the broken ends of the bone line up and are barely displaced

Compound Fracture (CFx)  |  aka "Open Fracture"
A fracture in which one of the displaced ends of the broken pierces the skin

Transverse Fracture
A fracture in which the fracture line is at a right angle to the bone's axis (Horizontal)

Oblique Fracture
A fracture in which the fracture line is curved, sloped, or at an angle

Communited Fracture
A fracture in which the bone is broken at a point into several pieces

Linear Fracture
A fracture in which the fracture line is parallel to the bone's long axis

Avulsion Fracture
A fracture in which a fragment of bone is separated from the main mass

Impact Fracture  |  aka "Buckled Fracture"
A fracture in which the broken ends of the bone are driven into each other

Spiral Fracture
A fracture in which a part of the bone has been twisted at the fracture point

Greenstick Fracture
