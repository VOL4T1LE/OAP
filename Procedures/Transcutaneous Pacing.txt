PREREQUESITES
 > At least one Peripheral Intravenous Line
 > Monitoring of the following vitals on the LIFEPAK 15:
	> Heart Rhythm
	> Heart Rate
	> Non-Invasive Blood Pressure
	> Blood Oxygen Saturation by Pulse Oximetry

PATIENT PREPARATION
 *I'd shave any excess hair at the pacing site*
 *I'd sterilise the site with 2% Chlorhexidine wipes*
 *I'd allow the site to dry*

ANAESTHESIA/ANALGESIA
 *I'd draw up 200mg of Ketamine Hydrochloride*
 *I'd ensure no impurities were present*
 *I'd connect the syringe to the pIV line*
 *I'd infuse the 200mg of Ketamine Hydrochloride over 60 seconds*
 > Maintenance of anaesthesia/analgesia with 2mg via pIV infusion every minute

ELECTRODE POSITIONING
 *I'd position the anterior electrode over the cardiac apex*
 *I'd position the posterior electrode inferior to the scapula*
 > The black pad is the anterior electrode, and should have a negative polarity
 > The red pad is the posterior electrode, and should have a positive polarity

PACING SETUP
 *I'd connect the electrodes to thhe LIFEPAK 15*
 *I'd set the pacing mode to "demand" on the LIFEPAK 15*
 > In demand mode, the pacemaker senses the intrinsic impulses and delievrs current only if necessary
 > If capture cannot be achieved in demand mode, attempt to use fixed mode instead
 *I'd set the pacing rate to 30BPM above the patient's intrinsic rhythm*
 > In other words, get the patient's heart rate and add 30BPM
 *I'd set the current to 70mA*

TRANSCUTANEOUS PACING
 *I'd begin pacing and increasing the current until pacing rate is captured*
 *Upon capture, I'd set current to 5mA above threshold*
 > To prevent interference, electrical devices, including smartphones, should be kept more than 2m away from patients undergoing TCP
